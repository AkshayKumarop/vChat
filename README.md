This project, as the name suggest, is a video calling program by which you can communicate to another person via video call but without any audio because i am new to java 
so i created it as much i know how to build. So i am studying furthure in java so that i can provide that feature in my project and another things is you can even send
or recieve file of any format. But it sounds weird that video call without audio then how can we talk to each other. So i just did partiality using text messaging. So you 
can do text messaging to each other.
